# 63.Unique Paths II

#### Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![1](img/62.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

一个m x n 的矩阵， 机器人开始在左上角，它只能向下或者向右走，问有多少种方案可以到达右下角。 

<br>

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```



#### Solution

跟前一题的区别只是，有的格子不能走，做法还是一样的，但是注意如果(i,j)这格不能走那么它的方案数为0.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.size();
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        
        int f[m + 1][n + 1];
        memset(f, 0 , sizeof(f));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j){
                if (i == 1) {
                    if (j == 1)f[i][j] = 1;
                    else f[i][j] = f[i][j - 1];
                }
                else if (j == 1)f[i][j] = f[i - 1][j];
                else f[i][j] = f[i - 1][j] + f[i][j - 1];
                if (obstacleGrid[i - 1][j - 1] == 1) f[i][j] = 0;
            }
        return f[m][n];
    }
};
```
