# 122.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

#### Description

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

<br>

给出stock每天的交易价，你可以进行无数次交易（每次购入一个和卖出一个）购入和卖出不能在同一天，在买入前必须把手头的stock先卖完。问最大收益。在没有购入的情况下不能卖出

#### Solution

就是找到所有递增区间的最大值和最小值的差值总和，等价于只要后一个比前一个大，就加上这两个的差值。


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int ans = 0;
        if (!prices.size()) return 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size() - 1; ++i){
            if (prices[i] < prices[i + 1])
                ans += prices[i + 1] - prices[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
