# 123.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

#### Description

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.

**Note: **You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

<br>

给出stock每天的交易价，你最多可以进行两次交易（每次购入一个和卖出一个）购入和卖出不能在同一天，在买入前必须把手头的stock先卖完。问最大收益。在没有购入的情况下不能卖出

<br>

#### Solution

枚举i，可以求出[0,i]和[i,n-1]这两段各自的最大收益，相加就是两次交易的最大值。各自求最大收益的方法同121题。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;
        int f1[prices.size()], f2[prices.size()];
        
        int minn = prices[0];
        f1[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i){
            minn = min(prices[i], minn);
            f1[i] = max(f1[i - 1], prices[i] - minn);
        }
        
        int ans = 0, n = prices.size();
        int maxx = prices[n - 1];
        f2[n - 1] = 0;
        ans = f2[n - 1] + f1[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i){
            maxx = max(maxx, prices[i]);
            f2[i] = max(f2[i + 1], maxx - prices[i]);
            ans = max(ans, f2[i] + f1[i]);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
