# 121.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

#### Description

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

给出stock每天的交易价，你只能购入一个和卖出一个，问最大收益。在没有购入的情况下不能卖出

#### Solution

简单dp，用一个ans维护答案，一个minn维护最低购入价格，然后遍历一遍，每次更新minn并用当前prices-minn更新答案。


```c++
#define rep(i,u,v) for (int i = (u); i <= (v); ++i)
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int ans = 0;
        if (!prices.size()) return 0;
        int minn = prices[0];
        rep(i, 1, prices.size() - 1){
            minn = min(prices[i], minn);
            ans = max(ans, prices[i] - minn);
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
```
